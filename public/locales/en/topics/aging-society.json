        "Celeste saw an elderly Japanese man fall out of his wheelchair on the sidewalk and helped him get home. She told him the address of her church, and later that week, he met her there. It was his first time in a church.",
        "In 2023 more than 29% of Japan’s population is aged 65 and over.<sup>1</sup> This is among the highest in the world and is increasing as Japan’s population shrinks due to declining birthrates and a growing number of “lifelong singles.”",
        "There are enormous long-term implications. Labor shortages have led to increased immigration and investment in artificial intelligence (AI). The healthcare and pension systems are under stress and many are concerned about the future.",
        "A growing number of elderly people live alone and are becoming socially isolated. The number of those dying alone at home has also been increasing. Some districts are making efforts to promote the well-being of senior citizens through campaigns and events.",
        "Christians are also trying to reach out. Some churches run exercise classes or host seniors’ lunches. Pastors visit elderly church members who are housebound or in hospitals. There are even elderly Christians who volunteer in nursing homes, seeking to befriend their peers."
