        "For more than five decades Japan has had an international reputation for cutting-edge technology. Visitors expect to see multilingual robots in stores, to be immersed in sophisticated virtual reality games, and to ride on the <i>shinkansen</i> (bullet train). Technology and media impact every sphere of society in Japan, including the church.",
        "Some progress has been made in producing Christian apps for children and adults, including one of the Japanese Bible. Social media and digital content are being used to share the gospel and to encourage believers, especially those who are isolated or live a long way from a church. But many Japanese churches with elderly congregations are struggling to keep up, as was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Churches without the capacity to move Sunday services online turned to mailing paper copies or CD recordings of sermons to congregants. ",
        "There are of course downsides to technology and media. We see young and old fixated on their phones, connected with content but disconnected from people. Some find their fullest identity and relationships in virtual settings rather than in their offline lives. The internet has created a platform for cybercrimes, pornography, bullying, and online predators. Concerns about privacy and false content continue to increase."
